This is an incomplete implementation of nginx for windows.  I've verified that I can make a request to localhost and receive index.html. 
There are probably features  that are missing, but since I'm not familiar with nginx, I have no idea what they are.

I did this mostly out of curiosity to see how much work it would take to fix the code to actually work on Windows.  Don't have any more free
time to work on it.
